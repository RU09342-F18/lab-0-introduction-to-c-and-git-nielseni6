This project is a simple calculator that that takes three inputs in the form:

  'Number1' 'Operation' 'Number2'
  
The first input that is asked for is the "Number1"

  -This number must be an integer
  
The second input that is asked for is the "Number2"

  -This number must be an integer
  
The third input that is asked for is the "Operation"

  -This value must be a single character
  
  -Characters that work include:
  
  _______________________________________
  | + Add (Number1 + Number2)           |
  
  | - Subtract (Number1 - Number2)      |
  
  | * Multiply (Number1 * Number2)      |
  
  | / Divide (Number1 / Number2)        |
  
  | % Modulus (Number1 % Number2)       |
  
  | < Left Shift (Number1 << Number2)   |
  
  | > Right Shift (Number1 >> Number2)  |
  
  | & Bitwise AND (Number1 & Number2)   |
  
  | | Bitwise OR (Number1 | Number2)    |
  
  | ^ Bitwise XOR (Number1 ^ Number2)   |
  
  | ~ Bitwise Inverse (~Number1)        |
  
  |_____________________________________|
  
Once all three of these values are entered the answer is printed as an output


Example Output:

Enter first number: 8

Enter second number: 4

Enter operator: *

32


Operation above: 8 * 4 = 32
